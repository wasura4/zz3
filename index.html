		<div>Deep in the heart of a small and sleepy village of Neverland, there was a farmer. He raised chickens, pigs, and cattle. He also cultivated corn and other vegetables. The farm was closed to the beautiﬁll green meadow, where the cattle and pigs grazed freely.</div>
		<div>Every morning and late afternoon the farmer would stand on the stone bridge to watch his ﬂock of animals. The stone bridge was only a short distance away from the hill. Atop of the hill was also his watch point, where he could see his entire farm and his little cozy cottage beside the little barn.</div>
		<div>One late afternoon before sunset, as he wa crossing the stone bridge, he saw an egg nestled in one of the branches of a nearby tree. He picked it up gently and carefully put it in his 
basket full of hay. 
"This egg seems big and unusual,"
he said to himself.


He went into the barn and laid the egg amongst the chicken eggs where the mother hen was roosting.

</div>
		<div>Then, after several days, he saw the mother hen slowly walking with her dainty newly hatched chicks.
They were all bright yellow except for one, which was very different from the rest and he could hardly stand up and walk. It was a baby eagle amongst the chicks.

</div>
		<div>The farmer led all the chicks and the baby eagle sunflower seeds.
As the days passed, the baby eagle adapted the ways of the other chickens. The farmer treated him like the other chickens, too. 
At times, he felt that he was not being accepted by the rest, for he was different from all of them; yet he behaved like them.
"What is wrong with me ?"

he asked himself.

</div>
		<div>"I know what's wrong with you
I ...... ..Your wings are too big For you, and in no time I will
clipppp ....... ..

……. ....... ..pp.........some of your feathers."

the farmer's Wife replied.

'What‘? Clip some of my Feathers?" he asked nervously.

"Ohhhh .....  1
Just wait and see 1" she replied.

		<div>This story that you are about to read has a history to itself. It is a children's storybook from stories from the Heart in my old menuscripts'folder. I had written and told these never ending stories to my students during my early years of teaching here and abroad. The critical thinking processes and the smiles in children's faces after hearing these stories, have been recorded in my inquiring mind, and thus promoted the publications of these children's storybooks. these stories from the heart are enchanting and make believe, yet thought provoking when the process of critical thinking is employed. they are storybooks of empowerment and discovery of oneself, as well as ones enjoyment in multicultural settings. At the end of each story. there are always moral lessons to learn, hidden and hidden. The uniqueness of these stories from the Heart are their twists: the text of sound effects and the repeated words and phrases for the readers and listeners to read and say them aloud, as they become the characters in the stories. This is the true essence of the sound of the storytellers: audience participation.

Therefore, I requested all the readers young at hearts to always read between the lines, as you read them aloud with the twists to you children at home or in schools. Reading between the lines is not hard to do or learn. Let me pause for a while, to let you get a piece or a sheet of white blank paper. Using a ball point pen. put a dot in the middle of it. Then, I will ask you a simple question: "What do you see?" If your answer was. "I see a dot." Then, I would say, "You are right!" But, right you maybe, is not what i want you to see. you must learn to see what most people failed to see. They could see and admire the beautiful full moon in one dark sacred night, but failed to see the big open space that surrounds the moon. It is a vast and mysterious space, for it not only holds the moon but, also all the heavenly bodies in it. It is this big open space that hold the tiny dot that you just dotted. This dot is nothing in comparison to the space around it. Throughout the pages of these storybooks. you will see events that will unfold; look then your innermost space.

This book, The Wind Beneath the Wings is an augmented and modified version of the classic story. The Eagles who Thought they were chickens by Michael Wynn. These empowering and inspiring books are both timely, multicultural, and classic in styles and formats.
And to all the Children of the world, enjoy your adventures and journeys as you read this Storybook. Thank you all for reading this Storybook, as iI have enjoyed writing and sharing with you!
